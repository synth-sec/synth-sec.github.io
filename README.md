This is a fork of Pixyll, a Jekyll theme, that attempts to look "Synthwavey".

To see what it looks like, check out [https://codingupastorm.github.io/](https://codingupastorm.github.io/).

Thanks to [Pixyll](https://github.com/johno/pixyll) and to [Synthwave 84](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode) for the code and inspiration.
